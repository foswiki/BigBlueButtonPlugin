BigBlueButtonPlugin integrates [[http://bigbluebutton.org][BigBlueButton]] web conferencing into foswiki.


%TOC%

BigBlueButtonPlugin integrates [[http://bigbluebutton.org][BigBlueButton]] web conferencing (also known as BBB) into foswiki. It promotes using virtual meeting rooms for collaboration by simulating physical meeting rooms:
   * All participants can become presenter.
   * Meeting rooms are easy to find and enter.
   * All participants have the option to see each other.
   * It is obvious who is talking.
   * You can see who is currently in the meeting room without having to enter first.

BigBlueButton is flash-based open source web conferencing, supporting web conferencing from most modern browsers without requireding software installation. With this plugin, your authorized wiki users are just a click away from talking to each other.

The Configuration for this Plugin lets you define one or more meeting rooms (usually following a naming theme such as flowers, painters, characters from Lord of the Rings...). The plugin will automatically create these meeting rooms on the BBB server, creates a wiki topic for each meeting room (a room named _Lotus_ will be described in topic !LotusConferenceRoom) and provides macros to join meetings and see who's in them. Topic %USERSWEB%.CategoryConferenceRooms is automatically created, listing all conference room topics.

This plugin also supports a REST interface, allowing other applications to use it to access virtual meeting rooms using foswiki authentication.

---++ REST Usage
   * %SCRIPTURL{rest}%/BigBlueButtonPlugin/listRooms returns a list of rooms configured by this plugin.
   * %SCRIPTURL{rest}%/BigBlueButtonPlugin/getJoinRoomUrl?room=Daisy returns a url that will log you into the room using your foswiki name.
   * %SCRIPTURL{rest}%/BigBlueButtonPlugin/joinRoom?room=Daisy automatically logs you into that room using your foswiki name.
   * %SCRIPTURL{rest}%/BigBlueButtonPlugin/getPeopleInRoom?room=Daisy returns a list of the people currently in the Daisy room.

---++ Examples
If you have configured BigBlueButtonPlugin to create a meeting room named 'Lotus', the statement
<verbatim>
%BBBROOMNAME{Lotus}%
</verbatim>
will create a link to the topic describing this meeting room, which includes the list of current participants and a link to join the room using your foswiki credentials. When you also installed [[http://foswiki.org/Extensions/ToolTipPlugin ToolTipPlugin]], hovering over this link will show you current participants, which is especially convenient when used in WebLeftBarLogin for example.

To create a link that, when clicked, will transfer people into the 'Lotus' meeting room, add this:
<verbatim>
%BBBJOINROOM{Lotus}%
</verbatim>

To display the room details for the 'Lotus' room:
<verbatim>
%BBBROOMDETAILS{Lotus}%
</verbatim>

---++ Configuration

Please delete %USERSWEB%.CategoryConferenceRooms and all !ConferenceRoom topics before making changes to the plugin's room configuration. The topics will automatically be re-created with up-to-date conference room list.

This plugin has the following configuration settings (set in %SCRIPTURL{configure}%):

   * *baseUrl*: the URL of BigBlueButton's API interface, for example http://demo.bigbluebutton.org/bigbluebutton/api
   * *salt*: the security salt for the above url, found in the server's /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/bigbluebutton/WEB-INF/classes/bigbluebutton.properties as beans.dynamicConferenceService.securitySalt. Example: 32321f1d-ae5e-4867-0071-9be6b70a9fcb
   * *rooms*: the list of rooms you want this plugin to create. Example: <verbatim>
[
  {
    'password' => '5678',
    'name' => 'Daisy',
    'audioBridge' => '71000'
  },
  {
    'password' => '5678',
    'name' => 'Iris',
    'audioBridge' => '71001'
  }
]
</verbatim>

The asterisk configuration on the BigBlueButton server must also declare your conference room names, otherwise you will have no audio. On the BBB server, in /etc/asterisk/bbb_extensions.conf, add:
<verbatim>
[bbb-voip]
...
exten => Daisy,1,Playback(conf-placeintoconf)
exten => Daisy,n,MeetMe(${EXTEN},cdMsT)
exten => Iris,1,Playback(conf-placeintoconf)
exten => Iris,n,MeetMe(${EXTEN},cdMsT)
</verbatim>
Note that the above example assumes that BBB has been configured to use the _MeetMe_ module for SIP.
